I've been continuing my data science self development and my next project was to create a knowledge graph from text data. 

A knowledge graph or sentiment graph is a graph structure that can show relational information. For example, if two words or entities are commonly used together in various contexts throughout large bodies of text, they may have a strong sentimental relation. We could also label the types of relations, for example:

-Subject: The entity that performs the action or is described.
-Predicate: The relationship or action connecting the subject and object.
-Object: The entity that is affected by the action or is described by the subject.

To begin with, I used a dataset from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health?resource=download) This is an amazing dataset which contains 50k+ records of statements from patients, describing their mental states. They're labelled with either anxiety or depression too.

I will be creating a sentiment graph using these texts.

Here's the results. 

Here's my github repo.

If you'd like to read more into this, I've written a short article about my project.
